			<div class="title heading">Dog Walking and Outings
			</div>
			<p>Dog walks are scheduled for 30 minutes, 60 minutes, or a half day outing. Walks are limited to dogs in your household in order to provide specialized attention for your pets.</p>
			<span class="full-bio"><p>If your dog prefers the company of other dogs, we can discuss pairing your dog with a buddy. A buddy is also good for shy pets as the buddy can lead by example for the shy dog.</p></span>
			<p>Outings can include visiting a dog park or a hike in the foothills.</p>
			<p><b>**Dogs must complete at least 2 individual walks before particpating in a buddy walk or an outing**</b></p>

			<div class="title heading">Pet Sitting
			</div>
			<p>Pets do best when they can stay at their home. <span class="full-bio">The stressors of a boarding facility may result in a weakend immune system which can make your pet more susceptible to infections and diseases.</span> I can offer pet sitting at your home or we can discuss boarding your pet at my home.</p>
			<p>I have taken care of the following animals:
				<div id="list-a">

		<div id="training" class="container services">
			<div class="title heading">Training for People and Pets
			</div>
			<p>Training pets starts with training people. I will teach you how to best communicate with your pet. Training sessions are in-person and the number of sessions would depend on the issues and the severity.</p>
			<p><b>DOGS</b></p>
			<p>Basic obedience is not just limited to commands. It also includes how your dog greets people as well as other dogs. A few topics that I can assist with include: destruction, separation anxiety, shyness, impulse control.
			</p>
			<p>I also specialize in puppy training. Providing puppies with direction, socialization, and enrichment will provide the foundation of a happy and healthy dog. Training a puppy is hard work but the benefits are so rewarding.</p>
			<p><b>CATS</b></p>
			<p>
			Is your cat having inappropriate eliminations? Do they attack as you as you walk by them? Do they cause trouble during the night and keep you up?</p>
			<p>I will be able to help you address certain behavior issues with your cats in order to help you both live happy and healthy lives.</p>

		<div id="counseling" class="container services">
			<div class="title heading">Adoption Counseling
			</div>
			<p>What kind of pet would make the best companion for your family? A young pet versus a senior pet? How often are you gone from home? How much time and effort do you want to put into training? Should you wait to adopt a dog until you have a yard? What activites would you like to do with your pet?</p>	
			<p>Counseling sessions will include an on-site visit to an animal shelter or adoption event to teach you how to evaluate a pet's temperament.</p>
